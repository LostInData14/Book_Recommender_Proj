# Book Recommendation System built using Flask as the backend framework.

The goal is to suggest books to users based on collaborative filtering techniques.

Key Steps Done in This Notebook:
- Data Preprocessing
- Merging datasets
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Building the Recommendation Model
- Popularity-based recommendation system.
- Saving the Models:
- Trained models were saved as .pkl files.
- Flask Integration:

A simple Flask app was created to serve the recommendations via a user-friendly web interface.

Models are loaded dynamically from .pkl files during API requests.

**Special Notes:**

- .pkl files are excluded from GitHub tracking via .gitignore.

- All necessary Python libraries are listed inside the requirements.txt file for easy setup.
